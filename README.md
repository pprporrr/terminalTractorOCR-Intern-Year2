# terminalTractorOCR-Intern-Year2
This repository documents the progress and achievements of the Terminal Tractor Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project undertaken during my internship year at Verily Vision. The initiative aimed to enhance the existing Container Truck Gate Automation system at Sahathai Terminal by incorporating OCR capabilities for identifying alphanumeric characters on terminal tractors. These specialized vehicles, exclusive to the terminal premises, lack license plates but display character sequences on their fronts. My primary responsibility in this project involved designing and implementing a robust machine learning component that effectively detects, interprets, and integrates these characters into the automation system.
The Terminal Tractor OCR project sought to enhance the Container Truck Gate Automation system at Sahathai Terminal.

## Getting Started
This section outlines the basic steps to get started with the Terminal Tractor OCR project:
 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
 2. Navigate to the project directory.
### Prerequisites
- Yolov8
### Testing the OCR system
You can test the ocr system by execute the TestImg.py script.

## Conclusion
The Terminal Tractor OCR project successfully enhanced the Container Truck Gate Automation system at Sahathai Terminal by incorporating Optical Character Recognition capabilities. Through meticulous model development, validation, and integration, the system now accurately identifies and interprets alphanumeric characters displayed on Terminal Tractors. This project stands as a testament to the collaborative efforts of the Verily Vision team and my own contributions, ultimately improving the efficiency and accuracy of the gate automation process at the terminal.
